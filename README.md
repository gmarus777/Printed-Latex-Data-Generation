# Printed-Latex-Data-Generation

Python and JS tools for generating Printed Latex Dataset (images of tex formulas with labels) via parsing Cornell's [KDDCUP](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/datasets.html).
Also see [KDDCUP paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kddcup2003.pdf).

**Note: parsing for ArXiv, Wikipedia and Stackexchange sources are coming.**

## How to generate data
The easiest way to generate data is via Jupyter Notebook `Data generation.ipynb` located in folder `Jupyter Notebooks/`.


Running it will output all the data in `Data` folder.

Final outputs
- folder `generated_png_images` contianing PNG images
- `corresponding_png_images.txt` each new line contains png images filename for the folder `generated_png_images`
- `final_png_formulas.txt` each new line contains a carresponing LaTex formula
- folder `raw_data` containing raw downaloded data
- folder `temporary_data` containing formulas from various stages of processing and svg images generated along the way

You can download a prebuilt dataset 180k from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7525894#.Y78raS2B2Lc).


**Note: This code is very ad-hoc and requires tinkering with the source**

## Depenencies
1. Tested with Python 3.9.7 and [Anaconda version 2021.11] (https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh)
2. `pip install opencv-python`
3. `pip install smart_open`
4. For Tex to SVG [see](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tex2svg):

    `sudo apt install nodejs npm`\
    `sudo npm install --global mathjax-node-cli`
     

5. For SVG to PNG:


  Linux:
  https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-universe-arm64/librsvg2-bin_2.48.2-1_arm64.deb.html
  
  
  `sudo apt install librsvg2-bin`
  
  <br />

  For MacOS:
  Download [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), also see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9853325/how-to-convert-a-svg-to-a-png-with-imagemagick)
